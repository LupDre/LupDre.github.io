## I've Got A New Twitter Account!

>And to celebrate, and to get new followers, I'm embedding a widget on my blog. You've seen these before on other sites and it's really easy to do.
>Just go to your twitter account settings and select "Widgets" near the bottom of the left-hand panel. Click "Create New" at the top. Change whatever options that best suit your needs and then just click "Create Widget". Then copy the code and paste into your site!
