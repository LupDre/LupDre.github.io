<ul>
  <li><b>1815</b> - Born in London, England as The Hon. Augusta Ada Byron</li>
  <li><b>1829</b> - Paralysed after a bout of measles.</li>
  <li><b>1831</b> - Able to walk on crutches and developed her mathematical and technological skills, despite being ill.</li>
  <li><b>1832</b> - Her mathematical abilites began to emerge and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life.
  <li><b>1833</b> - Introduced to Charles Babbage, also known as 'the father of computers', who showed her the prototype for his Difference Engine, which fascinated Ada.</li>
  <li><b>1835</b> - Married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King.</li>
  <li><b>1838</b> - Her husband was made Earl of Lovelace, thus becoming the Countess of Lovelace.</li>
  <li><b>1842-43</b> - Translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's machine, the Analytical Engine, and appended a set of notes. Of which, included a method of calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers with the Engine and was recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine which led her to be regarded as the first computer programmer.</li>
  <li><b>1852</b> - Died at the age of 36 of uterince cancer and buried next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.</li>
  
  <li><b>1980</b> - A computer language has been named after her called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)" target="blank">Ada</a>, on behalf of the U.S. Dept. of Defense and the Dept. of Defense Military Standard for the language, <i>MIL-STD-1815</i>, was given the number for her year of birth.</li>
  <li><b>1998</b> - The British Computer Society establishes an annual medal in her name, called the Lovelace Medal, which is presented to individuals who have advanced Information Systems or added significantly to their understanding.</li>
